# Two Sentence Horror Bot ü¶á‚ö∞Ô∏è
AI-generated two-sentence horror stories, using prompts from the subreddits r/Showerthoughts and r/OffMyChest. All that's in this repo is a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BYObHmAMviqI35oOmMlhMqDlB8n5r_ND?usp=sharing) that fine-tunes a pre-trained BART language model on a million top posts from the subreddit r/TwoSentenceHorror, and selects posts from Reddit to use as prompts for the model. Take a look at the colab notebook to see the code and some explanations of the methods used in this project!

See [@BartHorror on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BartHorror) for examples of this model in action. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

# Two Sentence Horror Bot
AI-generated two-sentence horror stories, using prompts from r/Showerthoughts.

All that's in this repo is a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BYObHmAMviqI35oOmMlhMqDlB8n5r_ND?usp=sharing) that fine-tunes a pre-trained BART language model on a million top posts from r/TwoSentenceHorror. It also randomly selects prompts from hot r/Showerthoughts posts.

See [@BartHorror on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BartHorror) for more examples of this model in action!
